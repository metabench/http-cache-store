# Future Enhancements and Technical Roadmap for http-cache-store

This document outlines future improvements, technical details, and plugin opportunities for http-cache-store. The ideas here cover cache management, eviction strategies, advanced logging, configuration management, and more. We also indicate which components can be implemented as plugins and which need to be part of the core system.

## 1. Cache Management and Eviction Strategies

### 1.1. Overview

Effective cache management is crucial for maintaining system performance and data freshness. Core concepts include:
- **Time-To-Live (TTL):** Each cached entry can have a TTL defining its validity period.
- **LRU (Least Recently Used):** Evicts entries that havenâ€™t been accessed recently.
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used):** Evicts entries with the lowest access frequency.
- **Manual Invalidation:** API endpoints to manually expire or clear cache entries.
- **Size-Based Eviction:** Eviction based on total cached size exceeding a threshold.

### 1.2. Plugin vs. Core

- **Plugin-able Components:**
  - **Eviction Strategy Module:** Eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU, TTL) can be implemented as plugins since they work on top of the core cache storage. A generic eviction interface can be defined which plugins implement.
  - **Cache Metrics and Monitoring:** Modules to track hit/miss ratios, response times, and usage patterns can be implemented as independent plugins.
  - **Notification and Alerting:** Email, SMS, or dashboard plugins that report cache health.

- **Core Lower Level Components:**
  - **Cache Storage Mechanism:** The database adapter and record classes (SQLite, DB schema, etc.) form the backbone and should remain in the core.
  - **Basic Retrieval and Insertion Logic:** How items are stored, queried, and linked to the cache key hashing.
  - **Compression Management:** As data compression directly affects storage and retrieval performance, it should remain a core part of the system.

## 2. Plugin Architecture

### 2.1. Approach

We plan to design a flexible plugin architecture. Plugins should be loosely coupled to the core system via defined interfaces. Some guidelines:
- **Interface Definition:** Core modules will define interfaces (or abstract classes) for components like eviction policies, logging, and metrics collection.
- **Dynamic Plugin Loading:** Use a configuration file or convention (e.g., a `plugins` directory) where the system loads plugins during startup.
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Leverage the event-driven nature of the system (already using `Evented_Class`) so plugins can subscribe to events (e.g., cache eviction, errors, performance metrics).

### 2.2. Potential Plugin Areas

- **Eviction Strategy Plugin:**  
  - **Interface:** Must implement methods like `onInsert(entry)`, `onAccess(entry)`, and `evict()` to choose which entry to remove.
  - **Examples:** An LRU plugin, an LFU plugin, or a hybrid strategy.

- **Logging and Monitoring Plugin:**
  - **Interface:** Provide hooks for events such as `cacheHit`, `cacheMiss`, `storeSuccess`, etc.
  - **Examples:** Integration with external logging frameworks, dashboards, or alerting systems.

- **Configuration Plugin:**
  - **Interface:** Allow runtime configuration updates or feature toggling.
  - **Examples:** A plugin to load config from a remote service instead of static files.

- **Compression Plugin Enhancements:**
  - **Interface:** Although basic compression is core, an advanced plugin could integrate alternative algorithms or tunable settings.

### 2.3. Plugin vs. Core - Summary

| Functionality                     | Core Component | Plugin Option      |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Data Storage (SQLite schema, DB records) | Core           | -                  |
| Basic Cache Operations (store, get, delete)  | Core           | -                  |
| Compression/Decompression         | Core           | Advanced compression adapters can be plugins |
| Eviction Policies                 | -              | Plugin (LRU, LFU, TTL)    |
| Metrics and Reporting             | -              | Plugin (custom dashboards)|
| Logging and Alerts                | -              | Plugin (third-party integrations) |
| Configuration Management          | -              | Plugin (dynamic configuration) |

## 3. Further Technical Details

### 3.1. Error Handling and Logging

- **Error Propagation:** Core functions (e.g., in Storage Adapter) emit `error` events. Plugins can subscribe to capture and process these errors.
- **Structured Logging:** Incorporate structured logging to JSON-based logs or integrate with services like ELK, Splunk or Grafana Loki.
- **Usage Metrics:** Record data such as cache hit/miss counts, response times, and compression performance. This data can be exposed via plugins.

### 3.2. Performance Metrics and Maintenance

- **Performance Metrics:** Using the `performance_metrics` table, the system tracks detailed metrics. A plugin could aggregate these metrics and generate reports or alerts.
- **Maintenance Tasks:** Automated tasks (like clearing stale cache, defragmenting SQLite) can be scheduled. Such tasks can either be plugins or cron jobs integrated with the system.

### 3.3. Security and Data Integrity

- **Data Validation:** Ensure input data is validated when stored. This is integrated in core components.
- **Encryption (Plugin):** A plugin could be developed to encrypt sensitive HTTP data before storage.
- **Checksum Verification:** Incorporate checksum or hash validation to ensure data integrity during compression/decompression cycles.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

1. **Define Plugin Interfaces:**  
   - Create abstract classes or interfaces for areas such as eviction strategies, logging, and configuration.
2. **Refactor Core Modules:**  
   - Adjust the Storage Adapter, Compression Manager, and DB adapters to emit events and call plugin hooks.
3. **Develop Basic Plugins:**  
   - Implement a simple LRU eviction plugin and a basic logging plugin to verify the architecture.
4. **Integrate Dynamic Loading:**  
   - Implement a loader that scans a folder (e.g., `c:\Users\james\Documents\repos\http-cache-store\plugins`) for plugin modules and integrates them into the system.
5. **Testing and Metrics Collection:**  
   - Develop testing suites to validate plugin interactions and measure performance impacts.

## 5. Conclusion

http-cache-store is a robust foundation for caching HTTP(S) requests and responses. By using a plugin architecture, it can be extended modularly to support advanced eviction strategies, analytics, logging, and security enhancements without altering the core system. This approach ensures the system is both flexible and scalable.

Happy caching and plugin developing!
